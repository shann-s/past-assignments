        <h2>About this template</h2>
        <p>Includes all the features that we have covered up until the end of Week 9.</p>
        <p>For example, role claims are now defined by a design model class, and initialized during the "load data" task.</p>
        <p>This template also includes graceful error-handling. </p>

        <h2>Do these tasks</h2>
        <p>In the Manager class, in the LoadData() method, add the role claims that you need for the app.</p>
        <p>Then, continue defining your own design model classes, and everything else you need to do to build the app. </p>
