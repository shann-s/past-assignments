// emplace_back, available in c++11, is a r-value push_back

// http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/emplace_back

// std::vector::emplace_back
//  
// template< class... Args >
// void emplace_back( Args&&... args );
// 
// Appends a new element to the end of the container. The element is constructed through std::allocator_traits::construct, which typically uses placement-new to construct the element in-place at the location provided by the container. The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as std::forward<Args>(args)....
// 
// If the new size() is greater than capacity() then all iterators and references (including the past-the-end iterator) are invalidated. Otherwise only the past-the-end iterator is invalidated.
